   <h2>Easy Apple Cider</h2>
    <p>This apple cider recipe is super easy to make. 
        I used to buy the spices already mixed at the grocery store,
         and they stopped carrying them, so I just made my own. 
         Great for a shower or get-together, 
         and the slow cooker keeps it warm so guests can enjoy it through the night!
          Serve with a slice of orange, and add spiced rum, if desired.</p>
